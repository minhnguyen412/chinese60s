Starting a new language can feel overwhelming—but it doesn’t have to be. The key is to follow a structured path, from beginner to advanced. This helps you build a solid foundation, retain what you’ve learned, and avoid getting lost if you ever take a break.
:::

This principle doesn’t just apply to Chinese—it’s the secret behind successful language learning in general.

## Step 1: Master the Basics First

If you're new to Chinese, it's essential to focus on the basics first. That means using a well-structured curriculum and understanding core grammar and vocabulary before jumping into more advanced topics.
Some of the most popular beginner Chinese textbooks include:

- HSK Standard Course 1–4
- Boya Chinese 1–2
- Msutong Chinese 1–4

These are widely used in language schools and universities, and they provide a clear learning path.

## Step 2: Keep Learning with the Right Tools and Support

To stay consistent and motivated while learning Chinese, you’ll need more than just a textbook. Here are a few key elements to keep your learning sustainable:

One of the best ways to maintain your enthusiasm is by watching basic Chinese animation videos. It’s even more effective if the videos follow the same structure as your textbook—this helps reinforce what you’re learning.

No matter how good the materials are, there will always be questions or things you don’t fully understand. Having a 1-on-1 tutor can make a big difference in helping you move past difficult points quickly and confidently.

:::step{num="3" id="step3" title="Practice with Friends or Join a Community"}
Learning a language isn’t just about studying—it’s also about using it. Try to find friends or a study group to practice with. If you have the chance, travel to China or Taiwan to immerse yourself in the language and culture.

## Step 3: Choose the Right Path for Your Goals
Not everyone learns Chinese for the same reason. That’s why your learning path may vary depending on your goals.
