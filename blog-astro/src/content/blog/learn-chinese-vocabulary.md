Learning vocabulary is one of the most essential—and sometimes most frustrating—parts of learning Chinese. But it doesn’t have to be boring or overwhelming.
:::lead
The most effective way to remember new words is not through rote memorization, but by engaging with them in real context, using multiple senses and repetition.
:::
Here’s a simple and powerful method to learn Chinese words that actually stick.

## Learn Vocabulary in Context

Instead of memorizing isolated words, try learning them within real sentences and conversations. This helps you understand how words are actually used and makes them easier to recall when speaking or writing.

**Chinese60s** provides dialogue-based lessons where every word appears in context—so you’re always learning naturally, the way native speakers use the language.

## Use All Four Skills: Listen, Read, Write, and Visualize

To truly absorb new vocabulary, activate multiple senses and learning styles:

- Listen to native pronunciation for each sentence
- Read the sentence and see how the word fits in
- Write the character by hand to reinforce memory
- Visualize with images linked to each word
With **Chinese60s**, every character in our dialogues is clickable. You’ll see:

- Pinyin
- Definition
- Image
- Audio
- Stroke order animation
This turns vocabulary learning into an engaging, multi-sensory experience.

## Practice Writing Instantly with Canvas

As soon as you learn a new word, you can open the Writing Canvas tab and start writing the character directly on your phone or computer.

Just type the word into the canvas, and it will:

- Display the correct stroke order
- Let you practice drawing the character in your browser

- You can also choose a specific number of words to study each day
It’s a great way to review in short, focused sessions—especially when you’re on the go or have just a few minutes to spare.

## Final Tip: Make Vocabulary Study a Habit, Not a Chore
The more you integrate vocabulary review into your daily life, the faster you’ll improve. With tools that combine visuals, audio, context, and interactivity, learning Chinese words becomes not only more effective—but actually fun.
